! Make Right Alt behave as Ctrl, useful for Emacs users, especially if you
! don't have a right Ctrl.

! remove ISO_Level3_Shift
! add control = ISO_Level3_Shift

! I've remapped the Alt and the Diamond (Muhenkan) key on my HHKB,
! want to use the old Alt (which now is Muhenkan) as an additional Ctrl.
add control = Muhenkan
